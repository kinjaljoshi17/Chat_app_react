# chat-app-react

I have created a real time chat application which is named as Let's Chat. In this react assignment, I have used my previous html and css files and added react component in the welcome page and used the props and state

I have created a welcome page which contains a button named 'click here to login', by clicking the button a user can navigate to the Login page, on the login page user should be able to login by using 2 specific set of credentials which are mentioned below:

1. emailAddress: "abc@gmail.com",
   password: "pass123",

2. emailAddress: "xyz@gmail.com",
   password: "pass123",

   If a user try to login by any other set of credentials then an error message will be displayed

   I have use the jest framework to add a unit test for my login page
